# Goal & Aims
This Do-it-Yourself (DIY) course is designed to provide a basic grounding of the Internet of Things (IoT).

* The aim is to equip students with the Data Science skills to be able complete basic  IoT scenariors. 
* Providing students with templates and a data-toolkit (code), which can be implemented through popular single board microcontrollers (Hardware).

# Required Hardware
See: https://github.com/robvdw/CMIDAT01K-DATA-SCIENCE-for-IOT/blob/master/Required_Hardware.md

# Scope
A hands-on introductory course exploring the Internet of Things form a (Human-Centered) Data Science point of view.

# Learning objectives
* Prepare a (Rapid) prototype for an Internet of Things (IoT) data-pipeline scenario
* Become familiar with Data Science concepts surrounding IoT applications
* Learn to design and develop simple lightweight IoTprototypes
* Learn to report on IoT prototypes & data-pipelines

# Delivearbles
* A working prototype that includes software (code), hardware and electronics elements.
* Code (commented) for the application
* Documentation of the project (contributed to a personal GitHub Repository).
* An online demo (video or IoT Platform implementation) of the completed IoT data-pipeline/project.

# DATA-SCIENCE-for-IOT-BASICS
This bachelor course is designed to provide a basic grounding of the Internet of Things (IoT).

The aim is to equip students with the Data Science skills to adress IoT pipelines. Providing them with templates and a data-toolkit (code), which can be implemented through popular single board microcontrollers (Arduino and/or Raspberry Pi).

# Technologies used
